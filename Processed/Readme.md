The Unicode plain text file still needs some significant cleaning up, in particular, the tables need to be formatted.

To assist in this, variants of the text file have been generated in a number of widths. The algorithm that generates the
table lay-out is fairly simplistic, and doesn't handle over-wide tables or tables with column or row spans properly, and
the nature of many tables in this book is such that they will require some manual tweaking anyway, to match the way they
are printed in the original book.
