<HTML><BODY>This is a German translation of "de revolutionibus orbium coelestium", the revolutionary book that promoted the heliocentric view of the universe. A magnificent work of late medieval science. Although Copernicus proposed a heliocentric view, he insisted on strictly circular motions, and for that reason also had to introduce epicycles to match the theory with observations (Only when Johannes Kepler introduced elliptical orbits, the model became less complex than the geocentric model used before).

<p>This book was published in 1879, translated from the Latin original to commemorate the 400th birthday of Copernicus (a little late). Although in German, it uses a normal font, so is easy to read. The book includes numerous diagrams and tables. For a few tables, the binding was a bit to tight, but numbers can easily be cross referenced <a href="https://archive.org/details/nicolauscoppern00thorgoog">from this alternative version</a> (in which some other pages are bad) or the <a href="https://archive.org/details/nicolaicopernici00cope_0">Latin original</a>. Please do not mark the page as bad if you can use those sources to resolve issues.

</p><p>For German style quotation marks (,,like this``) please use straight double quotation marks ("like this").

</p><p>For primes, double primes, etc., use single straight quotes; for superscript numbers used in stead of long rows of primes, use ^{IV}, etc.

</p><p>The small superscript numbers, followed by a parenthesis, refer to end-notes. Please format as footnote marker (e.g. [123]).

</p><p>The formula, especially in the notes at the end, will pose some problems. I propose to use TeX-like notation, that is: proof the square root sign as \sqrt{} with the material under the root sign between braces. Represent a horizontal division as \over, e.g. 1 \over 2, again using braces to group materials, e.g. {x^{2} - 1}\over{3x}.

</td></tr></table><p>The symbols in the book might differ slightly from how they appear in your browser here (especially the symbol of Capricorn, which in this book looks more like a combination of a 7 and a 6, see for example page <a href="https://www.pgdp.net/c/tools/project_manager/displayimage.php?project=projectID57deafe7da24e&amp;imagefile=107.png&amp;showreturnlink=1&amp;preload=next&amp;percent=100&amp;jumpto=106.png">85</a>). If you encounter any unlisted symbol, please turn the forum and mention it, I will update this table.

</p><p>Especially the notes contain many fragments in Greek. Transliterate following the general instructions.

</p><p>I am looking for a volunteer who likes to redraw these in SVG, if interested, please be in touch: it is not a small task, with some 150 (mostly fairly simple) diagrams to be drawn.
